# 📊 Instacart Reorder Prediction  

This project predicts whether customers will reorder products in their next purchase using the **Instacart dataset**.  
It demonstrates end-to-end **data science skills**: data wrangling, EDA, feature engineering, machine learning, and business storytelling.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore customer purchasing behavior  
- Build features that capture **user habits** and **product characteristics**  
- Train ML models to predict reorders  
- Evaluate performance using **precision, recall, and F1-score**  
- Translate findings into **business insights**  

---

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated  
- Data wrangling with **pandas, numpy**  
- Visualization with **matplotlib, seaborn**  
- Feature engineering (customer & product level features)  
- Machine Learning with **scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM**  
- Model evaluation (confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1)  
- Business communication & storytelling
